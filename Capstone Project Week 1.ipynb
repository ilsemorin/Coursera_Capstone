Specifically, this report will be addressed to **those students who need to rent a room to access their classes at Columbia University in New York City**.\n\nAs there are many studio apartments in New York City, we will try to detect places considering 3 factors; crime rate, rent cost and finally, proximity to places of preference. We would also prefer locations as close as possible to the university, assuming the first three conditions are met.\n\nWe will use data science to generate some more promising neighborhoods based on this criterion. The advantages of each area will be clearly expressed so that those interested can choose the best possible final location."
